Repos devoted to tools that were made during the first Open Sealab meeting in Oostende in the scope of EMODnet

There are python tools and functions to extract data from Copernicus and Emodnet.

Data were downloadeded for a certain area by hand (using the scripts) in the North Sea, and presented in an Rshiny app. 

Vulnerable and protected species were selected via the query on the OBIS database.
A kriging interpolation was done for one species (Dogwhelk) to get a cover (this interpolation can be made smarter, by using other information (most notably the Seabed Habitat map)


The magic has not been implemented yet. Further plan was:

- interactive tool to select area of interest (for wind farm, aquaculture etc)
- run scripts to download all possible data
- make smart interpolations on the fly of vulnerable species
- present everything in a map.
