\chapter{Overview}

In the table below, the statuses of all tests found in the testbed are summarized. The first three colomns identify the test with a combination of a binary, test and run name. The following three columns provide information on the status of that specific run. These columns indicate whether the model ran, the analysis ended succesfully and whether the run used default or custom settings. An empty status means the run or analysis is ignored, a cross indicates failure and a checkmark indicates success. The other columns in the table provide information on the model configuration.

Tests can be run multiple times using different settings. Different runs are identified by a run name, which follows after the test name. If a test runs once only, it is common use to name the run \textit{default}. This is not the same as running a test with default settings, which is indicated in the ``Default settings'' column.

The table provides all tests ran in a single testbed run. This report not necessarily uses all available tests. Therefore, not all tests in the table are necessarily found in the continuation of this report.
