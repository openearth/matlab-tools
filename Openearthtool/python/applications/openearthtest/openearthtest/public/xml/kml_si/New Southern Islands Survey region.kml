		<description>Dual-Frequency survey 

 
resolution roughly 25m along the transect, with roughly 200-300m spacing between track lines in less than 15 m water depth and roughly 500m between track lines in water depths greater than 15m.
No need for data in greater than 30m of water depth
survey as close to the shore as possible
survey as much around Jurong and Tuas as possible
single track
10% double coverage for checking by running perpendicular tracks to the main track orientation
Preferred main track orientation is across the steepest gradients in the bathymetry (typically cross-shore)
deliverables: Raw samples and samples converted to msl (prefered) or ordinance level</description>
