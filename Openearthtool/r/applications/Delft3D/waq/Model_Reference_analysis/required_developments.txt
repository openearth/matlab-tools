Model Reference Analysis

Here are opted developments listed which have not yet been implemented.

Input variables:
- HIS file
	- Read unit form HIS file

- list_of_variables_linked
	- Make it possible to toggle log transformation
	- Make it possible to input timezone of data
		- Make a check between timezones Simulated and Measurument
		- Automatic conversion
	

Structuring:
- Move multiple comparison from Model analysis towards GOF analysis
- Move Boxplots from Model analysis towards GOF analysis

Folders:
- Change name of Validation analyses to GOF (Goodness of Fit)

Plots:
- Seperate boxplots from continues lines/measurements in the month plot:
	- Show the measurements (blue triangles) and continuaous simulation in a seperate plot
	- Show the boxplots of decade measurements, exact measurements and boxplots of simulation in a seperate plot (maybe next to each other).
- Add an automated legend to the Year plot in Model analysis
- Add an automated legend to the Month plot in Model analysis
- Give range of the data used in decade data in Year plot in Model analysis
- Give range of the data used in decade data in Month plot in Model analysis
- In the Correlation Coefficient the equation should be added in GOF analysis.
- Add the creation date in the plot on the lower left corner
- Add other meta data in lower left corner
