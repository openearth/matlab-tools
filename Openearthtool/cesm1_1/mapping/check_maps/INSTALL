BUILDING
========

To compile this tool, you must be on bluefire. You also must set the
environment variable ESMFMKFILE=/contrib/esmf-5.2.0r-64-O/lib/esmf.mk (note that
after the -64 in the above path, it is a dash followed by the letter O rather
than the number 0). With this variable set, enter the mapping/check_maps/src/
directory and run

$ gmake

back in the mapping/check_maps/ directory, you should now have an executable
file named ESMF_RegridWeightGenCheck
