* changes on snctools -r3085
- allow an nc_dump to file directly 
- transpose vectors (1xn & nx1) so they always fit on a netCDF vector
- remember full path in nc_info (so you can pass it on as file handle)
- tmw backend cannot write empty attribute: added netCDf library fix for 2008b and 2009
- add comment on inconsistency with native matlab netcdf library to nc_dump and contents.m
- adapted get_varinfo.m and nc_get_attribute_struct.m for mexnc
