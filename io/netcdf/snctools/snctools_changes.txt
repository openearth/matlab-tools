from 2803:
* nc_attput.m: small bug when writing empty attributes (did not happen with jar/mex API).
* nc_isunlimitedvar.m: small error in error call.
* test_*: made test callable from any directory to be able to test a read-only version of snctools.
* test_nc_varget.m + test_nc_dump.m: replaced outdated ucar opendap link with a link to today's data.
