               <p>This tutorial will introduce you into the basics of software testing. Testing is becoming common practice in software development.
                  This also holds for the software that is being developed in the OpenEarthTools repository. This document describes a general
                  background on software testing and how we use the MTest tool to test our software in OpenEarthTools.
               </p>
               <p>Tests can be differentiated into various types. The most commonly used types will be shortly adressed in this tutorial. Finally
                  also a short chapter about TDD (test-driven development) is included.

               <div>
                  <p>Unit tests are the simplest to understand. A unit test tests a small part of the code (lets say a function like "sum" or "unique").
                     Because of this nature unit tests are normally very fast (because they only test a small fraction of a complete function,
                     class, or toolbox).

               <div>
                  <p>Integration tests are used to test the integration of multiple elements of a toolbox. This typically tests the coupling of
                     smaller parts that are already tested with a Unit test.

               <div>
                  <p>Both Unit tests and integration tests compare pieces of code against the desired functionality of that code (for example 1
                     + 1 should be 2). Regression tests typically compare the result of a function or toolbox with earlier results (a bench-mark).
                     This type of testing requires the possibility to publish results (to make it possible to visually inspect the results).

               <div>
                  <p>The following information is obtained from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">wikipedia</a> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development technique that relies on the repetition of a very short development
                     cycle: first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces
                     code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having
                     developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.
                  </p>
                  <p>Test-driven development requires developers to create automated unit tests that define code requirements (immediately) before
                     writing the code itself. The tests contain assertions that are either true or false. Passing the tests confirms correct behavior
                     as developers evolve and refactor the code. Developers often use testing frameworks, such as xUnit, to create and automatically
                     run sets of test cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>The test-driven development cycle can be summarized as follows: # <b>Add a test</b> (Each new feature begins with writing a test. This test must inevitably fail because it is written before the feature has
                     been implemented). # <b>Run all tests and see if the new one fails</b> (This is to ensure that the test is valid. It also tests the test harness). # <b>Write some code</b> (Write some code that will cause the test to pass). # <b>Run the automated tests and see them succeed</b> (If all test cases now pass, the programmer can be confident that the code meets all the tested requirements). # <b>Refactor code</b> (Now the code can be cleaned up as necessary. The tests are used to check whether the changes did not break anything).
                  </p>
                  <p>As can be concluded from the code above, applying TDD asks for the possibility to run Unit and regression tests.</p>

                  <p>The developers of OpenEarthTools are expected to want to perform a wide range of tests. Some of the tools are developed using
                     TDD (requiring the MTest toolbox to be able to run Unit and Integration tests), others are used to running regression tests.
                     Preferrably all code that is in the general directory is tested by unit tests. Applications are expected to at least have
                     integration, regression and / or acceptance tests. In this way it becomes clear to other  developments whether functionality
                     was broken by their latest commit by looking at the test results.
