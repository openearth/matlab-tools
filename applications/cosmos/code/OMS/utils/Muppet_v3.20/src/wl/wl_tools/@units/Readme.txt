
               MATLAB Units Object

This is a collection of M-files definining an experimental
MATLAB object that allows simple computations on quantities
involving units of measurement.

All the files should be installed in a directory named

   @units

(The first character in the directory name is an "at sign".)
This @units directory should be a subdirectory of a directory
on the MATLAB path, but @units itself should not be on the path.
For example

   .../my_home_directory/matlab/@units

or

   C:\matlab\work\@units

After this directory is created and the files installed there,
start up MATLAB and issue the command

   >> help units

By the way, many of the values used by the units object were obtained
from an excellent Web page developed by Prof. Russ Rowlett,
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:
