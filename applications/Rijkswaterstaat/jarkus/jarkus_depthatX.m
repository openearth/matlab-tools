function D = jarkus_depthatX(X,z,x)
% jarkus_depthatX calculates the depth at a certain distance
%
%   Input:
%     X = specified distance
%     z = vector with depths at locations x
%     x = vector with distances (for example distance from RSP)
%
%   Output:
%     D = depth at distance X
