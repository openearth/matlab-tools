function nesthd(varargin)
% NESTHD  nesting of curvi-linear hydrodynamic models (Delft3D-Flow & Rijkswaterstaat SIMONA(WAQUA/TRIWAQ)
%
% nesthd() launches GUI
% nesthd(keyword) runs in batch mode
%
% Help is available as Windows help file: NestHD.chm
%
% Unlike the Delft3D fortran nesth programs, nest_matlab has
% support for Neumann boundaries, Riemann boundaries, and
% tangential velocity components (parallel to open boundary),
