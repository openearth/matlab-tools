In test T1 of the Deltflume H298 series (Steetzel,1987) scour hole development in front of a dune revetment is ivestigated. The test was carried out at a depth scale nd = 5 (Vellinga, 1986) and the initial profile in the flume correponds to the reference profile for the Dutch Holland coast. At the dune foot (located at x = 193 m from the wave board and z = 3.80 m above the flumes floor) a concrete revetment is applied that covers almost the whole dune face (slope of 1:1.8). The lower end of the revetment is located at z = 2.5 m and the top end at z = 6.2 m. The test was conducted with a constant water level (set at z = 4.2 m) and wave conditions that correpsond to a Pierson Moskowitz spectrum with Hm0 = 1.52 m and Tp = 5.37s. The sand applied in the test has a median grain diameter ($D_{50}$) of approximately 210 um.
