Simulated and measured profile development are compared in (\autoref{fig:DeltaflumeH298_T1_default_fig1.eps}). In the physical experiment the scour hole devlops till a depth of z = 2.59 m above after seven hours simulation (is 1.21 meter below the dune foot). Computed bedlevel changes for sources and sinks (sourcesink=1) versus sediment transport gradients (sourcesink=0) are comparable. Without any relevant model improvements it is concluded that XBeach underestimates the erosion depth at the toe of the revetment. It seems an explaination may be found in simulated sediment suspensions in the proximity of the revtment, which are underestimated with a factor two (\autoref{fig:DeltaflumeH298_T1_default_fig2.eps}). The simulated mean flow is supposed to be in reasonable agreement with measurements.
