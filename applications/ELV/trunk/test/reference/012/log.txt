!!WARNING!!: Only one friction coefficient is supplied, but the channel is rectangular. 
!!WARNING!!: No action is taken. 
!!WARNING!!: We will use the variable width solver for rectangular channels 
!!WARNING!!: The hydraulic radius is approximated as the flow depth 
!!WARNING!!: For a space-marching initial condition no input-check is performed 
!!WARNING!!: The last time of the upstream hydraulic boundary condition in the boundary condition is not larger or equal to the simulation time. The hydrograph will be repeated.
