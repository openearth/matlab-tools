%% Initializing oetsettings
% if you use MATLAB and OpenEarth, you should always start off with running
% oetsettings. Oetsettings is essential to unleash the power of OpenEarth 
% to MATLAB. It adds all relevant toolbox paths to the matlab search
% path. 

%%
% Figure out what folder oetsettings.m is located in, and the run it. 
% (example for when OpenEarthTools checkout is in 
% D:\repositories\OpenEarthTools)

run D:\repositories\OpenEarthTools\oetsettings

%%
% As you don't want to remember this code, but you will run it every time
% you start MATLAB from know on, you should make a ahortcut for it on the
% shortcut bar. Just rightclick ==> new shortcut. Enter the command to run 
% oetsettings. If you save this, you can run oetsetings by pressing
% that shortcut button. You might even want to add some other commands, so
% matlab is effectiveley reset every time you press this button.
