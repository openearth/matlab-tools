%% 3. Creating tests
% At this moment engines are being prepared to automatically run tests. In an ideal world one writes
% a tests before writing the actual function. Tests also serve to judge whether changes you made to
% a low level function influence the outcome of an application. Tutorials for writing and running
% tests are being prepared. For now it is enough to know that (like creating a new function) there
% is also a function to create a test template: oetnewtest. The help of this function shows you how
% it can be used.
