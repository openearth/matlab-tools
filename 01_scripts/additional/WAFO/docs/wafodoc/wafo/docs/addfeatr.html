  NEW Functions 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  General conventions:
  Each line of code in the functions must not exceed 76 columns
  to ease the readability of the code. Function names must be written in lower 
  case letters without any underscores. Also local variable names should 
  preferably be in lower case letters. Global variables should be written in 
  upper case letters in order to avoid confusion with local variables. 
 
  Help header:
  Generally a function included in WAFO should be well commented and include 
  the following information in the given order in the help header:
 
  Header: (H1 line) Name of the function (in uppercase letters) followed by a
          concise and definitive description appropriate for retrieval purposes by
           the MATLAB \verb+lookfor+ command. Not to exceed one line.  
  Call  : Specifying the calling prototype, i.e. output argument(s),
          function name and input argument(s). Function name in lower case letters. 
  Outputs/inputs: A list describing the output and input arguments in
          the order they appear in the calling prototype. The description should
          also indicate the data type of the argument. An optional input argument is
          indicated by specifying the default value enclosed in parenthesis. Each
          line should be aligned so that all the equal-signs are in the same column.
  Description: Detailed explanation of what the function does, the
          assumptions made, the <a href="limitations.html" class="code" title=" (+)  WAFO known limitations">limitations</a> and how the algorithm works.  This
          should be as detailed as possible without exceeding one page.
  Side effects: If any like changing/using global variables, 
          changing properties of figure windows etc.
          should also be notified in the help header
  Example(s): An example of how to use the function in practice is desirable.
  See also  Comma separated list of related functions or functions which this 
            routine calls.
  Secret help:
  Immediately after the help header the following information should be given: 
 
  References: A complete reference from which the user can obtain further information
  Tested on : Specifies on which matlab version the function has been tested.
  History   : Revision log of the function in chronological order. 
 
  See <a href="../../wafo/spec/jonswap.html" class="code" title=" Calculates (and plots) a JONSWAP spectral density">jonswap</a> for an example on how it looks like in the WAFO toolbox
 
 
   NEW DATASETS:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   Signals: 
 
   [1] Choose a filename  (preferably with less than eight characters)  e.g. &quot;gullfaks&quot; 
 
   [2] Create an ascii data file named  &quot;gullfaks.dat&quot;, which contains your
       signal in vertical format with sampled values in columns.
       The documentation m-file explains what each column is a measure of.
       Sampling times if given should be in the first column.
 
   [3] Create an documentation file named &quot;gullfaks.m&quot; with the 
       following structure: (all in lower case letters if not explicitly stated otherwise)
 
  Title         : name of the m file in upper case letters followed by a 
                  descriptrive text. Not to exceed one line.
  Call          : indicating how to access the data
  Size          : The size of data.
  Sampling rate :
  Device        : Measuring device used to <a href="../../wafo/kdetools/sample.html" class="code" title="  Random sampling of points from a data-set ">sample</a> the data.
  Source        : Indication of the original source of the data
  Format        : Specifying the format of the data
  Description   : and other relevant facts of the data , \ie{} where and when the 
                  data were measured. An indication of the quality of the data should 
                  also be included.  Descriptive measures of the data like significant 
                  wave height, Hm0 , and peak period, Tp, may also be given here.  
                  Also restrictions on the use of the data if any should be given here.
  See also      : a comma separated list of related files or functions
 
   Example:
 
  GULLFAKS  surface elevation measured at Gullfaks C 30.12.1990
               
   CALL:  xn = load('gullfaks.dat')
   
  Size             :    2560 X 2
  Sampling Rate    :    2.5 Hz
  Device           :    EMI laser
  Source           :    STATOIL 
  Format           :    ascii, c1: time c2: surface elevation
  Description      :
    The wave data was measured 24th December 1989 at the Gullfaks C platform  
    in the North <a href="../../wafo/data/sea.html" class="code" title=" Surface elevation dataset used in WAT version 1.1.">Sea</a> from 17.00 to  21.20. The  water depth of  218 m is regarded 
    as deep water  for the most  important wave components.
    There are two EMI laser sensors named 219 and 220. This data  set  is obtained from
    sensor 219, which is  located in the
    Northwest corner  approximately two platform leg diameters away from   
    the closest  leg.  
    Thus the wave elevation is not expected  to be significantly 
    affected by  diffraction effects for incoming waves in the western sector.   
    The wind direction for this period is from the southwest.
    Some  difficulties in calibration of the instruments have been reported
    resulting in several consecutive measured values being equal or nearly equal 
    in the observed data set.
  
    Hm0 = 6.8m, Tm02 = 8s, Tp = 10.5

  NEW  DEMONSTRATIONS / PUBLISHED PAPERS:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   To add new demonstration scripts to the DEMOS directory:
 
   [1] Choose a name for your demo and a short prefix for files
       implementing your demo. For example, &quot;isope99&quot; and &quot;is&quot;.
 
   [2] Create the new subdirectory accordingly after the chosen name:
 
          WAFO/DEMOS/isope99. 
 
   [3] Create the m-files which implement your demo:
       isdemo    - starts a user controlled demonstration with <a href="../../wafo/misc/choices.html" class="code" title=" Create a list of choices with uicontrols and callbacks. ">choices</a>
       isinit    - sets up data structures, globals etc...
       isfig1,2..- called from isdemo. 
       isintro   - help file describing the purpose of the demo
       iscleanup - clears all globals created by the demo and restores the 
                   original workspace
 
   [4]  Specialized tools/functions not available in the official 
        release of WAFO needed for generating the figures should be put into 
        WAFO/DEMOS/isope99/private subdirectory.
 
       These are the rules for the scripts:
 
       I.   One m-file creates one complete figure, not a series
               of figures or a subplot of a figure.
       II.  If some variables in one script is needed by another script
               they  must be saved as global variables.
       III. No pause or prints statements allowed.
       IV.  As far as possible try to use the tools in WAFO
 
       Inspection of existing demonstrations will help in following these rules.
 
  
  
   To add new demonstration scripts to the PAPER directory is 
   similar to the DEMOS except that the scripts must recreate figures 
   in  published articles or technical reports.</pre></div>
