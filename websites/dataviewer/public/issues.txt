Issues with OpenEarth data viewer (option_compiled)
=======================================================================================================================

* How to let users add data to case-specific xml-files?
	- only registered users!
	- is this safe? no
	- version control of xml-files?
	
* How to speed up compilation of routines?
	- only Pieter can do it now and he has hardly any time
	- not convenient for testing 
	
* The interpolation routine has now hard-coded parameter names in it. How to generalize it?
	- netcdf files often have different parameter names, such as: lon, longtide, lon_center, etc.
	- also for latitude and z (height, depth, z, AHN250, etc)
	- and what about netcdf-files with multiple time steps in it?
	
* Plot timeseries functionallity, via button or in kml?
	- in kml seems to be more convenient, because you can use it also outside dataviewer (i.e. in Google Earth)
	- can we link to a web adress with input arguments to perform the action (like the 'python-way'?)
